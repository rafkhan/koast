Koast is provides a base for a backend server for an Angular.js app. (It my be
useful for Javascript apps built with other frameworks as well, but our focus
here is on Angular.) The purpose of Koast is to help you get quickly setup a
server that would take care of things that a typical angular app would need
(such as authentication and database access) without resorting to code
generation.

Koast consists of two parts:

- a server side npm package "koast"
- a client-side bower package "koast" (not yet available)

The npm package allows you to create a server, the bower package gives you
client side code that helps you talk to the server.
