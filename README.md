Koast provides a base for a backend server for an AngularJS app. (It my be
useful for Javascript apps built with other frameworks as well, but our focus
here is on Angular.) The purpose of Koast is to help you get quickly setup a
server that would take care of things that a typical AngularJS app would need
(such as configuration, authentication, and database access) without resorting
to code generation.

As of mid February 2014, Koast is an early stage project â€“ don't plan on
putting this in production quite yet.

Koast consists of two parts:

- a server side npm module "koast"
- a client-side bower package "koast"

The npm package allows you to create a server. In a typical case, you would
write a few lines of code to instantiate and start a server, defining most of
the functionality through configuration files, a schema file, and a module
implementing the API.

The bower package provides an AngularJS module that can helps you talk to the
server.
