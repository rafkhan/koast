Koast provides a base for a backend server to support an AngularJS app. (It my
be useful for Javascript apps built with other frameworks as well, but our
focus is on Angular.) The goal is to quickly setup a server that would take
care of things that a typical AngularJS app would need (such as configuration,
authentication, and database access) without resorting to code generation.

As of mid February 2014, Koast is an early stage project â€“ don't plan on
putting this in production quite yet. (But check back soon - we expect to have
something usable by mid march.)

Koast consists of two parts:

- A server side npm module "koast", which you can install with `npm install
  koast`. This module allows you to create a server. In a typical case, you
  would write a few lines of code to instantiate and start a server, defining
  most of the functionality through configuration files, a schema file, and a
  module implementing the API.

- A client-side bower package "koast", which you can install with `bower
  install koast`. This provides an AngularJS module that helps your frontend
  app talk to the backend server. You don't have to use this to use the server,
  but it might save you a bit of time.

      app
        index.html
        <all of your front end code, css, templates>
      bower_components
      custom_components
        <3rd party components you install bypassing bower>
