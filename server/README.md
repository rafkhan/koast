This is Koast's server side. It's organized as an NPM package providing a
requirable module ("koast") and a binary (also "koast"), which offers some
utilities. You cannot run the server by itself - you'll need to write a simple
app using the koast module. See examples in the "examples" folder in the root
of the repository.

To use git version of the module, install it locally using npm link:

  https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html

To use the binary, install the package globally (with -g).
