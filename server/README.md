This is Koast's server side. It's organized as an NPM package containing
exporting a module ("koast") and a binary (also "koast"), which offers some
utilities. You cannot run the server by itself - you'll need to write a simple
app using the koast module.

To use the module, install koast locally:

  npm install <path-to-koast-repo>/server

To use the binary, install koast globally:

  sudo npm -g install <path-to-koast-repo>/server
